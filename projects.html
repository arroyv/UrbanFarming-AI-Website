        <h2>Studying the role of (smart) technologies in urban food systems:</h2>
        <p>In partnership with TSTF, we will explore how an urban food system coalition consisting of Black and Brown community organizations perceives the role of (smart) technologies in fostering food sovereignty in low-income and historically marginalized and/or racialized settings. We are simultaneously co-designing urban gardens toward supporting the goals of food sovereignty and justice identified by TSTF.</p>
